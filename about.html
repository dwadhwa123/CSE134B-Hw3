        <h2>About Section</h2>
        <p>My name is Dhruv and I am a <b>junior</b> at UCSD majoring in <b>computer science</b>. One quote that defines me is <blockquote>
          "The only way to do great work is to love what you do." â€” Steve Jobs
        </blockquote>
          I got started in the field of computer science when I was in 6th grade and just enjoyed the problem solving aspect of it. Over the years, I've honed in my skills in multiple different languages and have completed projects on operating systems and computer networks. 
          Within Computer Science, some of my main interests include <i>artifical intelligence</i>, <i>machine learning</i>, and <i>software development</i>. What got me interested in AI and machine learning specifically where the limitless capabilities. I have mostly worked on simple predictive tasks
          but want to explore the field so much more. Every day I wake up with the mindset of improving and refining my skills so I can be as successful as possible in any task I undertake. 
          In my career, my main long term goal is not only to contribute but to lead impactful projects that make a difference.
